<p>Sure, emoji are üî• right now. Anytime a phone vendor adds or updates their emoji, it makes headlines. We all have friends (or are that person) that the new emoji are the compelling reason to upgrade. What&#8217;s the draw?</p>

<p>Humans have been been using ideograms for centuries, from heiroglyphs to modern city signs. Text based emoticons (smileys, like <code>:wink:</code> and <code>:stuck_out_tongue:</code>) surfaced in the early 80s as a useful way to add emotional context to online communication. Image-based emoticon popularity surged with internet forums. Emoji seem to bridge the gap between all three. They can add a simple straightfoward emotion, represent literal objects, or they can stand in for an abstract concept. They&#8217;re used by young and old, across all cultures, both formally and informally.</p>

<p>For example, for those who don&#8217;t want to know any of the technical details, we can flag that as skippable for them in this article with two emoji: ü§ìüö®.</p>

<p>At first it may have felt like emoji may be a trend, a passing fad of youthful communication. But the solidification of over 2500 emoji into the Unicode standard means they are here to stay. They will certainly evolve along with language, but we are past the tipping point where it&#8217;s optional for a software developer to care. Especially one that focuses on empowering its customers to publish their universe, like us.</p>

<p>Since it meant increasing our system requirements, we couldn&#8217;t support emoji any sooner than our next major version. So, ExpressionEngine 4 brings official support for emoji.</p>

<p>ü§ìüö®: Emoji are represented by multi-byte characters, and MySQL was not able to store them properly until version 5.5.3. Specifically, a superset of <code>utf8</code> collation that uses up to four bytes to store each character‚Äî<code>utf8mb4</code>‚Äîis required. ExpressionEngine 4 increased the minimum MySQL requirement to 5.5.3 so it can use <code>utf8mb4</code> by default.</p>

<h2>Upgrading from earlier versions</h2>

<p>Converting a database to allow it to store emoji is <em>fairly</em> straightforward. But it sometimes needs some manual tweaking, <em>and</em> if you have a large database, it might take a very long time to complete the operation. So a v4 upgrade does <strong>not</strong> automatically convert your database. Instead we made a standalone utility that will perform the conversion for you. You can <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/Emoji-Support">download it here</a>, and run it whenever you&#8217;re ready.</p>

<p>On an average install, it will complete in seconds. On a ridiculously large test database, the backup and conversion took about 20-30 minutes total for us. If you&#8217;ve ever had to take your site offline to perform a MySQL <code>ALTER</code> command, then you know you fall into that latter camp. If you aren&#8217;t sighing and nodding your head knowingly at üëÜ, you will probably be able to run the conversion in seconds. The conversion tool will also warn you if there are third-party tables that require modifications before you can convert.</p>

<p>ü§ìüö®: Character limits in MySQL are expressed in terms of 3-byte characters. Because emoji take 4 bytes to store, table indexes that might contain them can only hold 191 characters instead of 255. ‚åä255 * 3 / 4‚åã = 191. Maths, oy. The conversion utility will spell it out for you, and also help add-on developers be aware of what steps they need to take to support <code>utf8mb4</code>.</p>

<p>The conversion utility was made for ExpressionEngine 3 since it will mostly be used by folks who are upgrading. It will also work on v4 for those who have already upgraded. (Fun fact: it required no changes for v4 compatibility.) This means it can even enable your ExpressionEngine 3 installation to store emoji, addressing our all-time favorite bug report, titled: &#8220;<a href="https://expressionengine.com/support/bugs/21494/ee-cant-handle-the-poo-emoticon-and-many-others">EE can‚Äôt handle the Poo emoticon (and many others)</a>&#8221;. But until you upgrade to v4 you won&#8217;t have access to the coolest features:</p>

<h2>Emoji Shorthand Codes</h2>

<p>Storing emoji in the database properly is fine. But we also wanted to give content authors a simpler, more natural way to use emoji than having to open a character palette. So we decided to support emoji shorthand codes. If you&#8217;re a Slack or GitHub user, you are already familiar with them. You surround an emoji&#8217;s descriptive name with colons, and it renders the emoji. So I can type <code>:joy:</code> and display the most popular emoji of all, üòÇ. Or I can talk about how writing this blog post led me down a <code>:rabbit::hole:</code> (üê∞üï≥) of research on emoji usage, statistics, cultural differences, and even a <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/person-lotus-position/">podcast talking about the process of submitting and getting an emoji accepted into the Unicode canon</a>.</p>

<p>Any field that has formatting performed on it (Auto HTML, Markdown, etc.) will parse emoji shorthand automatically. Entries, comments, forum posts, wiki articles, add-ons, wherever. The source for short names comes from the <a href="https://unicodey.com/emoji-data/table.htm">Emoji Catalog</a>, and at times it is <em>slightly</em> behind Unicode. For instance, right now in iOS 11 there are some sweet new emoji like üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, ü§Æ, ü§™, and ü•°. If you&#8217;ve been looking for them on Slack and missing them, this is why. We use the same datasource for shorthand, and it takes a little bit to update after new emoji are added to the lexicon.</p>

<h2>Emoji Template Tags</h2>

<p>Lastly we added an <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/add-ons/emoji/index.html">Emoji module</a> that gives you some template tags to work with emoji. You might build your own front-end emoji picker with the <code>&#123;exp:emoji:emoji_list&#125;</code> tag:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:emoji:emoji_list&#125;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" onclick="addEmoji(':&#123;short_name&#125;:');"&gt;&#123;html_entity&#125;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&#123;/exp:emoji:emoji_list&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or you might parse emoji shorthand codes from content sourced outside of ExpressionEngine with <code>&#123;exp:emoji:parse_shorthand&#125;</code>:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:emoji:parse_shorthand&#125;
  Flying a :rocket: to Mars with Elon Musk
&#123;/exp:emoji:parse_shorthand&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>That&#8217;s right, ExpressionEngine finally has a one-click updater.</p>

<p>All 7,000+ lines of the new updater code were written wondering what it was going to be like to ship 4.0.1, our first in-app update. Well, it seems to have gone off without a hitch! We&#8217;ve since delivered hundreds of in-app updates with, as far as we know, a 100% success rate. But it wasn&#8217;t luck, it took much deliberation to achieve those stats.</p>

<p>When I was presented with the task of writing a one-click updater from scratch, it was daunting. In addition to the sheer technical challenge, it&#8217;s a feature that has the power to make sweeping changes to the file system and database. It&#8217;s an enormous responsibility, not only with a site&#8217;s data and uptime, but with our customers&#8217; trust. It has to work well.</p>

<p>The benefit of not being first to market with this feature is that there have already been many attempts to solve this problem. There are many documented cases of failed automated CMS updates out there on forums and Stack Overflow, we just had to go learn from them.</p>

<p>What became clear was that updating is scary, and that when an update blew up, the user was left with a feeling of helplessness, having to take to the internet while their site was down. So how do we (a) prevent things from blowing up in the first place? and (b) empower the customer to fix things on the off-chance that something does blow up?</p>

<p>Using this combination of empathy-driven and explosion-averse engineering, here are a few key decisions we made to make our updater one of the best.</p>

<h2>Use Resources Sparingly</h2>

<p>One of the most common complaints of in-app updaters is they run out of memory or exceed some time limit. So it was clear we needed to break up the large task of updating into small, bite(byte?)-sized chunks. Downloading is its own task, unpacking is its own task, verifying file integrity is its own task, and so on.</p>

<p>This presented a problem with database backups. For certain backwards-incompatible changes, we want to make database backups in case something happens and the update needs to be rolled back. But what if the data we need to back up is a bazillion gigabytes? We ended up creating a backup utility that could backup a database of any size on limited resources, provided you at least have the disk space. We did this by splitting the backup into small chunks per web request. This ended up working so well, even better than phpMyAdmin for large databases, that we made it available as a standalone utility in the control panel.</p>

<p>Another potentially resource-intensive task is updating ExpressionEngine&#8217;s files. Some updaters <em>copy</em> their new files into place, but users would report more failures if there were a lot of files to update, due to the increased time and memory usage. We solved this simply by <em>moving</em> files instead of copying. Moving files takes a fraction of the resources needed to copy, and since we only have to move the root folders, updating the files stays fast and lightweight no matter how many files need updating.</p>

<h2>Empower the Customer</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re all familiar with holding our breath before clicking that Update button. What if it fails? What state does that leave my site in? How do I roll back? Is my site going to be down until I get some help? Clicking Update should be exciting, not fill you with anxiety and uncertainty.</p>

<p>The updater was engineered from the beginning to catch as many preventable failures as possible and provide you with actionable steps to solve them. But if something unexpected happens, we offer a one-click rollback action that should put your install back exactly the way you had it. We achieve this through performing the actual upgrade through an independent micro-app that sits outside your ExpressionEngine install. This way, for example, if moving the new files into place fails and leaves some files updated and some not, we have a known good set of code we can run to set things straight again.</p>

<p>But what if even that fails? In that rare case, the customer should be able to get themselves up and running again with just a few steps and no feeling of helplessness. <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/installation/update.html#cannot-rollback-a-failed-upgrade">Move a few files around</a>, optionally import a database backup, and you are back in business. Plus you always have the option of performing a two-folder manual upgrade √† la ExpressionEngine 3.</p>

<p>Not only do these steps keep the customer in control, but it reduces our support load. Having released a few updates to ExpressionEngine 4, so far we have not had one support request for a failed update. And over half of all v4 production sites are either on the latest patch release or only one patch release behind.</p>

<h2>Stay Secure</h2>

<p>Security is an important selling point of ExpressionEngine, and as you can expect, we&#8217;ve brought that same consideration to the updater. For instance, we&#8217;ve included a <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/installation/update.html#updating-via-command-line">command-line updater</a> if you prefer extra control over your file permissions. But there&#8217;s one more, big, security problem to solve.</p>

<p>The updater is essentially an automated process that downloads code from somewhere and then executes it on your server. What if that code isn&#8217;t ours? What if someone is able to fool ExpressionEngine into downloading and executing someone else&#8217;s code on your server?</p>

<p>We did a lot of research into the best practices for secure code delivery, and arrived at a cryptographic signing system so that ExpressionEngine knows it&#8217;s getting code from us and only us. Some popular PHP package delivery systems are behind in this area, and one popular CMS is <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309">currently vulnerable</a> to one of the largest remote code execution attacks the world has ever seen. Sleep well tonight.</p>

<h2>Keep Calm and Update</h2>

<p>One of my favorite quotes is &#8220;make the right thing easy.&#8221; It can be applied to many facets of life, but is particularly useful in software design. Having the latest features, stability fixes, and security patches should be easy. We hope this feature goes a long way in reclaiming your valuable time and ultimately makes updating a delight.</p>

				<h1>The Wait Is Over!</h1>

<p>ExpressionEngine 4 hits the streets today, and is available for immediate purchase and upgrade. ExpressionEngine 4 is packed to the gills!</p>

<figure><img src="https://expressionengine.com/asset/img/blog/v4-launch-blog-news@2x.png" alt="v4 is here!"></figure>

<p>Here are some of our favorite features of the new version:</p>

<h2>One-click Updater</h2>

<p>Keeping your CMS up-to-date is critical for security and performance, but many of us don&#8217;t make the time for it. ExpressionEngine 4 brings you simple, reliable, and secure in-app updates that makes staying up-to-date a cinch.</p>

<h2>Fluid</h2>

<p>ExpressionEngine 4 has a brand new fieldtype: <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/fieldtypes/fluid.html">Fluid</a>. This fieldtype allows content authors to create rich, long-form content using components made from <em>any custom field</em> you configure it to use. The content creator can publish the content they want, in the order that they want, without compromise. And the site builder retains full control over the markup and presentation as you&#8217;ve come to expect from ExpressionEngine.</p>

<figure><img src="https://expressionengine.com/asset/img/blog/fluid.gif" alt="Fluid field"></figure>

<h2>Channel Fields, Unleashed</h2>

<p>Channel Fields are now assigned √† la carte for maximum reusability across Channels and even Sites. Create smart, re-usable components and assign them as needed. Three Channels all need some SEO-related fields? No problem, create the fields once, and assign them to all of the Channels you want. You can even optionally group them as an organizational convenience to assign them all at once with a single click.</p>

<p>Along with this change, the Channel Manager has been completely overhauled to simplify the creation of Channels and Fields. You can now intuitively create your information architecture all from one screen, creating and assigning fields and statuses in one spot. You can even quickly design new Channels that need many fields thanks to &#8220;Save &amp; New&#8221; functionality on creation.</p>

<h2>Layout Lists</h2>

<p>Layouts are the ultimate tool to decrease the costs and time associated with building and maintaining dynamic sites. Now a new world of staying DRY has opened up with <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/templates/layouts.html#layout-variables">Layout Lists</a>. You can <code>&#123;exp:layout:append&#125;</code> and <code>&#123;exp:layout:prepend&#125;</code> your Layout Variables, unlocking an intuitive way to make your layout templates smarter and dynamic.</p>

<p>For example, create a Layout List from Channel entry titles:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='news'&#125;
  &#123;layout:set:append name='titles'&#125;&#123;title&#125;&#123;/layout:set:append&#125;
&#123;/exp:channel:entries&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then loop through your list in your layout with the <code>{value}</code> variable:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;layout:titles&#125;
  &#123;value&#125;&lt;br&gt;
&#123;/layout:titles&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Fewer Plugins Required</h2>

<p>ExpressionEngine 4 delivers a host of new global <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/templates/variable_modifiers.html">variable modifiers</a> to perform common formatting tasks <em>directly on the variable</em>, reducing the number of plugins required. Character and word limiting, string replacement, numeric formatting, making content safe for use in HTML attributes and form inputs, common encoding/decoding needs, and even encryption.</p>

<p>For example, to make sure the content author&#8217;s <code>{seo_descrip}</code> field doesn&#8217;t garble the HTML and that the meta description tag only outputs 150 characters:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code class="html">&lt;meta name="description" content="&#123;seo_descrip:attr_safe limit='150'&#125;"&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Emoji Support üëèüíÉüèªüéâ</h2>

<p>Emoji storage is now fully supported in ExpressionEngine. Further, all the popular emoji short codes that you&#8217;ve come to know and love are parsed in typography (<code>:rocket:</code> becomes üöÄ).</p>

<h2>So much more</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s too much to fit into a single post! Dozens and dozens of other improvements and refinements await you. It&#8217;s a brand new experience and more capable than ever before. You can read the changelog for more details, but you really just have to experience it yourself!</p>

<h2>Upgrade Pricing</h2>

<p>Upgrades from ExpressionEngine 3 are only $99, plus $49/site for multi-site licenses. But we have two specials going right now:</p>

<ol>
<li>Now through the end of the year, additional sites on multi-site licenses <strong>are free to upgrade</strong>.</li>
<li>If you purchased or upgraded to ExpressionEngine 3 on or after October 24th, 2017 (and before 12/6/2017), you can upgrade right now <strong>absolutely free</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today we released the ExpressionEngine 4 Developer Preview. What&#8217;s new?</p>

<h2>One-click Updates</h2>

<p>Finally, amirite? Keeping your sites secure and up to date couldn&#8217;t be easier. One-click updates, with the attention to security that you expect from ExpressionEngine. Power users can even run updates from the command line.</p>

<h2>Fluid Fields</h2>

<p>Fluid fields are a brand new field type that lets an author flow content in the order they need for the ultimate flexibility. This article needs text => image => text => image => image. Another article in the same channel needs video => text => image => text. No problem.</p>

<p>Content authors get flexibility without compromise. Site builders keep 100% control of the markup and presentation. You can make Fluid fields from a combination of any other field types, including Grid.</p>

<h2>Fields, Unchained</h2>

<p>Fields now have unparalleled flexibility. You can assign fields to Channels a-la-carte, they can live in many field groups (or none), and you can use them across all your Sites. Fewer fields, simpler templates and site builds.</p>

<h2>Channel Manager</h2>

<p>ExpressionEngine 4 has a new intuitive workflow for creating your information architecture. Click once to create a new Channel, then select or create new fields on the fly without ever leaving the page. Just create components in the order that you think of them. No browser tabs, no refreshing, no mental juggling.</p>

<h2>Template Variable Modifiers</h2>

<p>ExpressionEngine 4 reduces how many plugins you need for common output tasks. Using content inside an HTML meta tag or data attribute. JSON encoding. Character limiting. Formatting currency, and much much more. Simply add the modifier to your template variable: <code>{my_variable:json}</code></p>

<h2>Layout Variable Lists</h2>

<p>Layout Variables can now work like lists, adding values to an existing Layout Variable. You can even synchronize lists of related data to use together later. For example: pairing URLs and titles to create both HTML and JSON-LD breadcrumbs in your layout from the same lists.</p>

<h2>Database Backups</h2>

<p>A key step for one-click updating is backing up your site&#8217;s database. We&#8217;ve also made this available to you as a standalone, in-app database backup utility. Simple, reliable, and in our experience it works even better than phpMyAdmin on large databases.</p>

<h2>Support for üí©</h2>

<p>üéâ</p>

<h2>Update my add-ons, again?</h2>

<p>We know most of you had to deal with gathering and updating add-ons to upgrade to version 3. Our goal for this release is for most add-ons to need zero or minimal changes. We&#8217;ll do our best to catch any exceptions during the Preview and help developers provide simple solutions. But there are still plenty of <em>optional</em> new things for developers to take advantage of. We&#8217;ve sent a full list of those changes to developers in the Preview.</p>

<p><em>Developers</em>: check your inbox for access to downloads and some of the nitty-gritty details. As always, you can post your questions and bug reports to the <a href="https://expressionengine.com/forums/topics/128/developer-preview">Developer Preview forums</a>.</p>

<h2>When? How Much?</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ll announce those details along with pricing soon. Rest assured, there is no penalty for buying ExpressionEngine 3 today. Any purchases of ExpressionEngine 3 (including upgrades) made from here until v4 goes on sale will get a <strong>free upgrade</strong>. And in celebration, upgrades to v3 are <a href="https://expressionengine.com/store/purchases/upgradeable"><strong>on sale for 10% off</strong></a> for the remainder of the week. Enjoy!</p>

<p>We are super excited about ExpressionEngine 4 and hope you are too. We&#8217;ll be taking deep dives into all of these features in the future, as we&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface here!</p>

				<p>The solar eclipse was not a harbinger of doom afterall.  Yay!  In celebration, here&#8217;s ExpressionEngine 3.5.11.</p>

<p>Template parsing of large templates should be faster and so should the control panel&#8217;s edit entry page. We ditched some extra AJAX validation that was occuring when clearing out file fields. You&#8217;ll also spot the addition of a per page filter to a number of tables in the template manager, the member manager and the channel administration pages.</p>

<p>Bug fixes were well represented this release.  There were over a dozen fixes, including everything from accommodations for IE&#8217;s JSON ignorance to forum notification settings that needed to stick. The Simple Commerce module can send HTML emails again and if your MySQL server setup doesn&#8217;t start your new table off with an index of 1, that&#8217;s no longer a problem for the installer.</p>

<p>Third party developers weren&#8217;t forgotten.  There were several fixes to legacy libraries. The file model now deletes files more intelligently and password validation errors show the proper password length.</p>
